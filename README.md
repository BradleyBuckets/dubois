# dubois

Ok, so that was a whole ordeal.

The original premise for this project is to use webpack.
While a valuable skill, it is very job specific.

I will instead focus on two things:
1 - creating all the html through js
2 - creating a styled and nice looking website

I made a template in figma to use so I can deviate from the "google default" styling that a lot of my projects have used in the past.
